How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

47. It does not accept 0 as an insertMoney value
48. It would accept 0 as a parameter
50. I forgot :(
51. It doesn't instantly eat everything in the ticket machine and checks how
    much money is inserted first
52. It's possible, but it will break the entire code by making it so nothing
    will happen if nothing is inserted and an error will be printed after
    we insert money and get our ticket
53. No as it verifies that there is enough money to print a ticket
55. saving = (price * discount)
56. mean = (total / count)
59. It will return 0
60. It will not compile
61. It says int price instead of price.
    Though it compiles, price will be set to 0 as there is no pure price
    variable
64. I don't know I need serious help :((((((
